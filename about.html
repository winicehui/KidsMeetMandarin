        <p> Kids Meet Mandarin, then called Chinese Storytime, first began in
          Fall of 2008 at the Scripps Ranch Miramar Local Library by local
           chinese teacher Ms. Areana Chen and her eldest son, Alwin Hui.
           What first started off as a small afterschool program for kids
           across the Scripps Ranch Community to learn a new language
           has now grown to serve over 200 kids, from toddlers to young
           middle-schoolers.
         </p>
         <p> The program continues to this day, every Friday in the children's
           area of Scripps Miramar Library from 3:45-4:45pm. Kids not only will learn
           simple words and sentences in Mandarin, but they will also garner
           a  taste and exposure to the complex culture of
           China. We strongly believe that children learn best not through
           textbook and rote memorization, but through hands-on-crafts,
           songs and interactive activities. Hence, our program incorporates
           many crafts and creative activities. Kids love the program and
          always leave with a smile on their face! </p>
